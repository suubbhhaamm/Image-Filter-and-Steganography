    <h1>SECRECY WITH STEGANOGRAPHY</h1>

    <div id="infoDivision">
      <p>
        <b> Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection, 
        the secret data is then extracted at its destination. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding
        or protecting data.<br>
        Basically its a concept in which we can hide data inside an image. Here, data could be in image form only. Therefore we can conclude saying
        that it allows to hide some other image inside an image. <br><br>You can acknowledge this from below 2 sections:<br><br>
        
        ➤ <u>Hidding Section:</u> Here viewable image and the image to hide are uploaded and the resulting image with secret image hidden is obtained
          this can be download by simply right clicking and then saving the image<br><br>
        
        ➤ <u>Revealing Section:</u> This is the section where image with secret image is upload then upon pressing display the ordinary and secret image 
          can be viewed.<br><br>
        **Please give it a try to experience secrecy by steganography process**</b>
